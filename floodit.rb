  # This method should return a two-dimensional array.
  # Each element of the array should be one of the
  # following values (These are "symbols", you can use
  # them like constant values):
  # :red
  # :blue
  # :green
  # :yellow
  # :cyan
  # :magenta
  #
  # It is important that this method is used because
  # this will be used for checking the functionality
  # of your implementation.
